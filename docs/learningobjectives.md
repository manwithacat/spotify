# Data Analytics with AI Hackathon: Dashboard Essentials

**Duration:** 4 Days

[Code Institute Hackathon Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vThNllbMORJoc348kFavz4mZWT1-33xyazdD2L-3AlTfORlRhuDyT0xmCBQMD2C-K2djQQipt6te6lo/pub)

## Overview

In this hackathon, you will build a Data App with a User Interface (UI) that combines Python packages for Data Analysis and Data Visualisations for fast Data Analytics prototyping. This project will allow you to perform critical data analysis, generate useful insights, and deliver data-driven recommendations.

The project immerses you in an environment that fully reflects professional business requirements. It achieves this by encouraging you to reflect on the "whys" and "hows" of a data analysis system that delivers tangible value to your organisation. The UI and the data analysis are conducted in accordance with the business requirements.

## Introduction

Welcome to the four-day hackathon focused on Dashboard Essentials. Participants will work collaboratively in teams of three to explore and analyse data using interactive dashboards in an app, Power BI Desktop or Tableau Public. This hackathon aims to enhance participants' skills in data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data visualisation, and storytelling through interactive dashboards.

### Team Structure

- **Ideal team size:** Up to five participants
- **Collaboration:** All team members collaborate on projects
- **Responsibility:** Each member actively contributes throughout the four days
- **Principle:** Shared responsibility to ensure balanced workload and successful outcomes

> Note: Allowances will be made for numbers that don't fit the ideal member breakdown.
