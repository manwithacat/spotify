## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `make train` fails with "No such file"

**Solution:** Run `make test-pipeline` or `make prepare-data` first:

```bash
# Option 1: Use synthetic data
make test-pipeline

# Option 2: Use real data
make prepare-data
```

### Issue: `make mlflow-ui` shows no experiments

**Solution:** Run training with MLflow tracking:

```bash
make train-mlflow
```

### Issue: `make mlflow-ui` fails with Alembic migration error

**Error message:**
```
ERROR mlflow.cli: Can't locate revision identified by 'bf29a5ff90ea'
alembic.util.exc.CommandError: Can't locate revision...
```

**Cause:** Database corruption or MLflow version mismatch

**Solution:** Reset the MLflow database:

```bash
make mlflow-reset
make mlflow-ui
```

This will delete the corrupted database and create a fresh one on next start.

### Issue: `make lint` or `make format` not working

**Solution:** Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install flake8 black pylint mypy
```

### Issue: `make streamlit` or `make gradio` fails

**Solution:** Check if apps exist and dependencies are installed:

```bash
ls app.py app_gradio.py
make setup
```

## Environment Variables

Some commands respect environment variables:

### MLflow Tracking URI

```bash
# Override default SQLite backend
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://mlflow-server:5000"
make train-mlflow
```

### Python Path

```bash
# Add custom Python path
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:./src"
make train
```

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Always run `make help` first** to see available commands

2. **Use `make full-pipeline` for testing** - it's fast and doesn't require data

3. **Use `make mlflow-ui` to compare experiments** - visual comparison is easier than reading logs

4. **Run `make format` before committing** - maintains code consistency

5. **Use `make view-plots` after training** - quick visual inspection of results

6. **Chain commands with `&&`** for dependent operations:
   ```bash
   make train && make mlflow-ui
   ```

7. **Use `make test-pipeline` for CI/CD** - fast validation without real data

8. **Run `make clean` periodically** - keeps repository tidy
