## Dataset Content
The data set used for this project: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset). The collection of ~114,000 songs across 125 genres with features like danceability, energy, tempo, and popularity. Ideal for audio analysis, genre classification, and music trend exploration.

The dataset consists of the following columns:
* track_id: Unique Spotify identifier for each track.
* artists: List of artists performing the track, separated by semicolons.
* album_name: Title of the album where the track appears.
* track_name: Title of the song.
* popularity: Score from 0–100 based on recent play counts; higher means more popular.
* duration_ms: Length of the track in milliseconds.
* explicit: Indicates whether the track contains explicit content (True/False).
* danceability: Score (0.0–1.0) measuring how suitable the song is for dancing.
* energy: Score (0.0–1.0) reflecting intensity, speed, and loudness.
* key: Musical key using Pitch Class notation (0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, etc.).
* loudness: Overall volume of the track in decibels.
* mode: Indicates scale type (1 = major, 0 = minor).
* speechiness: Score estimating spoken content in the track.
* cousticness: Likelihood (0.0–1.0) that the song is acoustic.
* instrumentalness: Probability that the track has no vocals.
* liveness: Measures if the song was recorded live (higher = more live).
* valence: Positivity of the music (0.0 = sad, 1.0 = happy).
* tempo: Speed of the song in beats per minute (BPM).
time_signature: Musical meter (e.g. 4 = 4/4 time).
track_genre: Musical genre classification of the track.

## Business Requirements & Solutions
1. **Understand Key Drivers of Song Popularity**
Stakeholders want to know which track features (e.g., genre, energy, length) drive popularity.
**Solution**: XGBoost ML model with feature importance analysis
- Interactive dashboard shows top 20 most important features
- Genre is the strongest predictor (importance: 0.0986)
- Track length, explicit content, and energy levels are significant
- **Access**: ML Model tab in Streamlit dashboard
2. **Classify Songs by Mood and Energy**
The product team requires a system to categorize songs by mood for mood-based playlists.
**Solution**: Automated mood/energy classification system
- 4 mood categories: Happy/High Energy, Energetic/Sad, Chill/Happy, Sad/Low Energy
- Based on valence (positivity) and energy scores
- Visualized in interactive pie charts
- **Access**: Visualizations tab → Mood & Energy section
3. **Genre-Level Analysis**
Marketing and analytics teams need insights into genre trends and performance.
**Solution**: Comprehensive genre analytics and visualizations
- 114 unique genres analyzed across 114,000 tracks
- Top 20 genres by track count displayed
- Genre-specific popularity trends
- **Access**: Data Explorer + Visualizations tabs
4. **Support Playlist Curation**
Users should be able to filter and find similar tracks for playlist creation.
**Solution**: Advanced filtering and similarity search
- Filter by genre, popularity range, and audio features
- Download curated track lists as CSV
- Find similar successful tracks in the same genre
- **Access**: Data Explorer tab with multi-select filters
5. **Data-Driven Music Recommendations**
Music producers need predictive tools for optimizing new track performance.
**Solution**: AI-powered recommendation engine for track optimization
- Predict popularity for new tracks (0-100 score)
- Get up to 5 actionable recommendations to maximize audience
- See potential impact of each change (+5 to +12 popularity points)
- Compare against successful tracks in the same genre
- **Access**: Track Predictor tab (music producer tool)


## Hypothesis
1. Genre is a strong predictor of popularity.
 Confirmed by: XGBoost feature importance — Genre ranked #1 (importance score: 0.0986).
2 Songs with higher energy and valence are perceived as more positive/mood-lifting.
Confirmed by: Mood classification into 4 quadrants using energy and valence; shown in mood pie chart.
3. Explicit content and short track length tend to lower popularity.
Confirmed by: Negative correlation in model feature importance scores and popularity predictions.
4. Most popular genres have a wider spread of track counts and variability in popularity.
Confirmed by: Genre distribution charts and popularity histograms in the Genre Analysis dashboard.
5. Audio features can be used to accurately predict a track’s future popularity.
Confirmed by: Model predictions (0–100 scale) with ~80% accuracy and test-set performance.

## Project Plan
* Data Acquisition & Preparation
  * Load and explore the Spotify tracks dataset from Kaggle.
  * Clean and preprocess data: handle missing values, convert duration to minutes, normalize/scale relevant features.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Analyze distribution of popularity, tempo, valence, energy, and other audio features.
  * Visualize relationships between key features using:
      * Correlation heatmaps
      * Pairplots and histograms
* Interactive Streamlit Dashboard 
  * Full-featured web application with 4 tabs:
    * Data Explorer - Browse and filter tracks
    * Visualizations - Rich, interactive charts
    * ML Model - Feature importance and performance
    * Track Predictor - Predict + optimize new tracks
  * Real-time popularity predictions with AI recommendations
  * Music producer workflow for track optimization

## Ethical consideration
This project utilizes publicly available Spotify track data for the purpose of educational data analysis and machine learning model development. The following ethical aspects were taken into account:
* **Data Privacy:**  
  The dataset does not include any personal or user-specific information. All data refers to music track features and metadata that are publicly accessible through Spotify APIs. No individual listeners are identified or targeted.
* **Copyright and Usage Rights:**  
  Although track metadata (e.g., names, artists, albums) is included, no copyrighted audio content is used. The dataset complies with fair use for academic and non-commercial research purposes.
* **Bias and Fairness:**  
  The dataset may reflect biases in genre popularity or artist representation due to Spotify’s algorithmic and user-driven metrics. These biases can affect model predictions and should be acknowledged in analysis or applications.
* **Responsible Use of Predictions:**  
  Any popularity or mood predictions made using this data should not be used to marginalize artists or genres. The results represent trends in the data, not objective quality judgments.
* **Transparency:**  
  All analysis steps, assumptions, and model performance evaluations are documented for transparency. This promotes responsible AI usage and allows users to understand how conclusions were derived.
